#### Overview
This project involves implementing a CPU Scheduling Simulation in Python, focusing on different scheduling algorithms such as "First Come First Serve" (FCFS), "Priority Based," and "Round Robin." The primary objectives include maximizing throughput, minimizing wait time, minimizing latency or response time, and maximizing fairness in CPU allocation. Achieving these goals requires the scheduler to transition processes through various states, considering factors like process type and making strategic decisions on resource access, particularly the CPU. As these objectives often conflict, the scheduler must strike a suitable compromise. The success lies in the scheduler's ability to determine the order of resource access, aligning with the specific needs, priorities, and workloads of each process.
